Styled as a form of multi-media poetry with interactive and AR components, the Ferriday.Zone evokes sense of simultaneous displacement and familiarity. 

The user is challenged to explore the difference between perceiving and knowing through combinations of images styled as newsprint, quizzical aphorisms, and investigations of artificial intelligence systems.

At times both comedic and tragic, the experience seeks to defamiliarise the user's memory of the past and imagination of the future in order to induce an awareness of the dehabitualized now.
